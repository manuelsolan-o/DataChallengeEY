# EY Data Challenge: PE Investment Opportunity: ITESO Acquisition

This repository contains a collection of Python functions and Jupyter Notebook demonstrations for analyzing and visualizing ITESO's educational data. The project focuses on understanding ITESO's profile and market position by examining key metrics such as student enrollment, cost of attendance, and growth trends across multiple academic cycles. The insights derived from this analysis serve as a basis for evaluating ITESO's competitiveness in the education market and its potential as a strong commercial investment.

## Features
### Data Cleaning & Querying:
Scripts to clean and prepare raw data from various academic cycles, thta can be found in modular functions that can be easily integrated into Jupyter Notebooks for further exploration and custom analysis, enabling deeper analysis of ITESO's performance.
